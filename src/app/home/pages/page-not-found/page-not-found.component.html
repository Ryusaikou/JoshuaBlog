  Best practice dictates that you will not be blamed for reaching this page,
  Even though you could have entered litterally nothing into the url and not ended up here
  I dont blame you... Im just disappointed.

  Seeing as I am the only person who should come across this page before its published, 
  If you are not future Josh, Future Josh has failed to redo the 404 page.
  Future Josh was supposed to be better than this. How dare you future Josh.
